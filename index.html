      <p>This studio is an introduction to research, analysis, and the interpretation of content, emphasizing how
hierarchical and syntactic structures participate
in (influence and/or determine?) the making of
meaning. Students are oriented as shapers and
interpreters within culture.<br><br>
Our course is divided into two parts
(based on the academic calendar) and
will involve two substantial projects/
creative investigations focused on
<i>Catalogues and Archives</i>, inspired by
personal interests and fascinations,
and <i>Futures and Narratives</i>, informed by myth, history, artifacts, and/or speculation.</p>

              ⨂ Class overview.<br>
              ⨂ What's a piece of graphic design that you deem inspiring?<br>
              ⨂ In a 1500 by 1500 pixel file, using only Illustrator tools and limited to black and white, draw a) a self-portrait and b) your friend. You can only use your mouse/mousepad (using drawing stylus is forbidden). <i>Avoid making a photorealistic line drawing of yourself/your friend through tracing</i>. Instead, try to draw them based on your own aesthetic sensibility and try to incorporate Illustrator effects into the drawing. Aim for unexpected discovery of Illustrator's tools, because the less you know about Illustrator, the better the outcome. After you finish with them, export them as .png or .jpg, put them into one folder, compress the folder, and then send it to anggarah@vcu.edu.<br>
              ⨂ Create an <a href="https://www.are.na/" target="_blank">Are.na</a> channel if you don't have one. Install <a href="https://www.are.na/tools/bookmarklet" target="_blank">Are.na Chrome extension</a> and read <a href="https://support.are.na/help/how-do-i-use-the-browser-extension" target="_blank">the tutorial</a> how to use it.<br><br>
              ⨀ Collect images to create 7 separate collection. Each collection must comprise at least 6 individual items. You may find these items already grouped in one image (e.g. shoes from the page of a fashion catalog), or you might group items from disparate sources to make a new collection according to your own criteria (e.g. various candy wraps, torn ticket stubs, empty containers, etc.). What constitutes a collection is determined by you and should reflect your interest. Print out or glue down each collection on 8.5 by 11 inches sheet of paper so that you have 7 sheets total, one page per collection. They can be in color or black & white and their presentation should be neat but straightforward. Our interest for the moment is in the images, not the way they are presented. Label the collections on the reverse side of the page and insert them in a standard three-ring binder (at least 1-inch thick), either by three-hole punching them or by inserting them into plastic sleeves (you will continue to add to this binder for the rest of the class). Have your collections reflect your interests and look for thematic links. Aim for diversity in subjects and their media sources. <mark>This is due by next Monday.</mark>

              ⨂ In-class critique for 9 people for your collections (divided into small groups of 3). After the critique, you can start with the class exercises for this week.<br>
              ⨂ Examples (typography) are available in Canvas under Files.<br>
              ⨂ In a 1500 by 1500 pixel file, using Photoshop or Illustrator (or a combination of both), create a texture based on your current collection. You need to have at least 5 different textures in total. Play around with Photoshop’s Filters and Illustrator’s Effects in particular to achieve unexpected outcomes. <i>The results need to be abstract and don’t imply any images</i>. After you finish with them, save them as .jpgs.<br>
              ⨂ Pick one paragraph from <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-english-so-weirdly-different-from-other-languages" target="_blank">"English Is Not Normal" by John McWhorter</a> and make a typographical poster <i>only</i> using Google Docs limited to black and white. Think about the composition of the letters in each poster. Can you hide some of the letters in plain sight? Can you omit some of the letters? Can you dissect your words? How would the meaning of the word be altered if you design the poster in landscape mode instead of in portrait mode? Even though we're only using two colors, think about using black as white and white as black and also black/white gradients. After you finish with it, save it as a .pdf.<br><br>
              ⨀ Flip the class.

            ⨀ For the continuation of the collection assignment, I would like you to begin a new collection of something. It should be something physical and man-made, and ideally it should have a particular visual quality that intrigues you. It will help if your object is not overly complex (does not have too many component parts) and is relatively cheap to collect and/or easy to document (if it is large or environmental). Some examples include: ticket stubs, joints, key holes, wheels, pens, cardboard boxes, postcards, bottles, buttons, receipts, bricks, arches, road signs, etc. Simpler items tend to make for more rewarding investigations. If you select an item that is fairly complex and multifaceted like a shoe, focus on just one small part of it, and perhaps a part that you are less familiar with. As your collection grows, become attuned to the similarities and differences among your specimens and aim for a wide variety. <mark>For the next class, document at least 6 collection specimens in 3 different ways so that you have 18 images total (3 sets of 6 images). Print your images on 8.5 by 11 inches paper, 2 images per page (this will give you 9 pages total), and insert these pages into your 3-ring binder.</mark> The goal is to decide on a method of documentation that best reveals the qualities within the object that you are interested in. This will vary depending on your object, but here are some means you might consider: xeroxing to highlight shape and contour, scanning (enlarging?) to reveal very precise detail, making a rubbing to emphasize texture, or using a camera if your object is large and/or environmental. If primarily using a camera, consider photographing your objects from different angles, at different times of day, or under different lighting conditions. <mark>Lastly, write a short statement (approximately 200 words) explaining your interest in the collection you are starting. Print the statement on 8.5 by 11 inches paper and add it to your binder.</mark>

          ⨂ In a group of 4 or 5, bring out your collections to the table and I want you to assess your peers' collection.<br>
          ⨂ Afterwards, in a Google Docs, write your feedback for people you had assessed. Try to point out these followings: a) their documentation methodology and visual strategies, b) the coherence of their collections that are being presented, and c) is there a picture that resonated with you (why?). After you finish with them, save it as a .pdf and send it to anggarah@vcu.edu. <mark>This is due by the end of today's class.</mark><br>
          ⨂ Find a print publication (i.e. flyer, poster, newsletter, pamphlet, etc.) from the internet. It should not be commercial but rather in the political, social, or cultural realm. After carefully examining its contents (words, images, symbols, textures, etc.), reconsider the hierarchy of information based on what, in your opinion, communicates the content in a more effective, succinct, and powerful manner. You can edit the content for clarity’s sake and style (i.e. you may deem it desirable to simplify a call to action like "call (804) 828-2787 for more information" to simply listing the number), but do not omit critical information that would impair its functionality or change the nature of the event (i.e. if a flyer is annoucing a screening of 4 films, don’t change it to 2, or change the names of the films).<br>
          ⨂ Based on your findings, recreate that poster by deconstructing the design of the original printed matter you selected, and reassembling it in such a way that you create an entirely new image. Work on this for the remainder of the class. After you finish with them, send it to anggarah@vcu.edu. <mark>This is due by Friday.</mark><br>
          ⨂ Examples (forms) are available in Canvas under Files.<br><br>
          ⨀ Once you’ve determined the most interesting way of documenting your objects, you will pick one method and build your collection further to culminate 40 images by next week. <mark>This is due by Monday.</mark>

            <p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
            <div class="left">
              The departmental faculty have drafted a revised attendance policy, carefully considering the challenges and realities of holding classes in different spaces and in fractured time frames.<br><br>
              The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of times the class meets in one week. Our department has adopted a revised policy that addresses larger issues of expected engagement in a course. Consistent engagement is a vital component of successful completion of course objectives. The progression of this course requires all participants to be present and actively engaged in class, both during synchronous on-screen meetings, in person, and with asynchronous activities. Consistency of engagement is vital for successful completion of the course objectives. Each of us carries different circumstances and capacities; we are accountable for our own agency. This is always true, but especially crucial now. We are a community.<br><br>

              Be present for this class; participate consistently in the regular give-and-take of the classroom environment; be willing to share thoughts and experiences, as well as willing to actively listen to the thoughts and experiences of others.<br><br>

              Asynchronous engagement is equally important for your success in this course. If at any point during the semester you are unable to be present, communicate this clearly with me in a timely manner. Think about the manners in which you feel you will be able to be fully present and active with your community—this may differ from how others respond.<br><br>

This class operates on the principle of charity, respect, and good faith. The responsibility to uphold and bolster these principles falls equally on all members of the class. Active listening is as important as active participation, please be gracious and generous with both. Connecting with peers is encouraged but does not substitute for communicating with the instructor directly. Contact me as soon as possible prior to, or after you miss a class. It is your responsibility to make-up for missing work.

          <p><strong>Evaluation</strong></p>

          <div class="left">You will receive ongoing feedback on your work in group critiques and individual critiques with me. Projects and performance in this course will be evaluated with respect to three primary dimensions:<br><br>

⨁ <u>Participation:</u> your overall conduct throughout the duration of the project as you engage with the project and with your peers. Attendance, meeting deadlines, and being prepared for class will also be accounted for.<br>

⨁ <u>Process:</u> strength of your personal methodology and practice; idea generation and exploration; self evaluation; overall rigor in your approach to the project; articulation and presentation of your work; criticality.<br>

⨁ <u>Execution:</u> the quality of your ideas; craft; clarity of organization and presentation, how your materials (paper choice, imagery, typography, etc) connect to your concept.
