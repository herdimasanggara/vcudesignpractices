      <p>This studio is an introduction to research, analysis, and the interpretation of content, emphasizing how
        hierarchical and syntactic structures participate
        in (influence and/or determine?) the making of
        meaning. Students are oriented as shapers and
        interpreters within culture.<br><br>
        Our course is divided into two parts
        (based on the academic calendar) and
        will involve two substantial projects/creative investigations focused on
        <i>Catalogues and Archives</i>, inspired by
        personal interests and fascinations, and <i>Futures Narratives</i>, informed by myth, history, artifacts, and/or speculation.

              ⨂ Class overview.<br>
              ⨂ What's a piece of graphic design that you deem inspiring?<br>
              ⨂ In a 1500 by 1500 pixel file, using only Illustrator tools and limited to black and white, draw a) a self-portrait and b) your friend. You can only use your mouse/mousepad (using drawing stylus is forbidden). <i>Avoid making a
                photorealistic line drawing of yourself/your friend through tracing.</i> Instead, try to draw them based on your own aesthetic sensibility and try to incorporate Illustrator effects into the drawing. Aim for unexpected discovery of
              Illustrator's tools, because the less you know about Illustrator, the better the outcome. After you finish with them, export them as .png or .jpg, put them into one folder, compress the folder, and then send it to anggarah@vcu.edu.<br>
              ⨂ Create an <a href="https://www.are.na/" target="_blank">Are.na</a> channel if you don't have one. Install <a href="https://www.are.na/tools/bookmarklet" target="_blank">Are.na Chrome extension</a> and read <a
                href="https://support.are.na/help/how-do-i-use-the-browser-extension" target="_blank">the tutorial</a> how to use it.<br><br>
              ⨀ Collect images to create 7 separate collection. Each collection must comprise at least 6 individual items. You may find these items already grouped in one image (e.g. shoes from the page of a fashion catalog), or you might group items
              from disparate sources to make a new collection according to your own criteria (e.g. various candy wraps, torn ticket stubs, empty containers, etc.). What constitutes a collection is determined by you and should reflect your interest.
              Print out or glue down each collection on 8.5 by 11 inches sheet of paper so that you have 7 sheets total, one page per collection. They can be in color or black & white and their presentation should be neat but straightforward. Our
              interest for the moment is in the images, not the way they are presented. Label the collections on the reverse side of the page and insert them in a standard three-ring binder (at least 1-inch thick), either by three-hole punching them
              or by inserting them into plastic sleeves (you will continue to add to this binder for the rest of the class). Have your collections reflect your interests and look for thematic links. Aim for diversity in subjects and their media
              sources. <mark>This is due by next Monday.</mark>

              ⨂ In-class critique for 9 people for your collections (divided into small groups of 3). After the critique, you can start with the class exercises for this week.<br>
              ⨂ Examples (typography) are available in Canvas under Files.<br>
              ⨂ In a 1500 by 1500 pixel file, using Photoshop or Illustrator (or a combination of both), create a texture based on your current collection. You need to have at least 5 different textures in total. Play around with Photoshop’s Filters
              and Illustrator’s Effects in particular to achieve unexpected outcomes. <i>The results need to be abstract and don’t imply any images</i>. After you finish with them, save them as .jpgs.<br>
              ⨂ Pick one paragraph from <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/why-is-english-so-weirdly-different-from-other-languages" target="_blank">"English Is Not Normal" by John McWhorter</a> and make a typographical poster <i>only</i> using Google
              Docs limited to black and white. Think about the composition of the letters in each poster. Can you hide some of the letters in plain sight? Can you omit some of the letters? Can you dissect your words? How would the meaning of the word
              be altered if you design the poster in landscape mode instead of in portrait mode? Even though we're only using two colors, think about using black as white and white as black and also black/white gradients. After you finish with it,
              save it as a .pdf.<br><br>

              ⨀ For the continuation of the collection assignment, I would like you to begin a new collection of something. It should be something physical and man-made, and ideally it should have a particular visual quality that intrigues you. It
              will help if your object is not overly complex (does not have too many component parts) and is relatively cheap to collect and/or easy to document (if it is large or environmental). Some examples include: ticket stubs, joints, key
              holes, wheels, pens, cardboard boxes, postcards, bottles, buttons, receipts, bricks, arches, road signs, etc. Simpler items tend to make for more rewarding investigations. If you select an item that is fairly complex and multifaceted
              like a shoe, focus on just one small part of it, and perhaps a part that you are less familiar with. As your collection grows, become attuned to the similarities and differences among your specimens and aim for a wide variety. <mark>For
                the next class, document at least 6 collection specimens in 3 different ways so that you have 18 images total (3 sets of 6 images). Print your images on 8.5 by 11 inches paper, 2 images per page (this will give you 9 pages total), and
                insert these pages into your 3-ring binder.</mark> The goal is to decide on a method of documentation that best reveals the qualities within the object that you are interested in. This will vary depending on your object, but here are
              some means you might consider: xeroxing to highlight shape and contour, scanning (enlarging?) to reveal very precise detail, making a rubbing to emphasize texture, or using a camera if your object is large and/or environmental. If
              primarily using a camera, consider photographing your objects from different angles, at different times of day, or under different lighting conditions. <mark>Lastly, write a short statement (approximately 200 words) explaining your
                interest in the collection you are starting. Print the statement on 8.5 by 11 inches paper and add it to your binder.</mark>

              ⨂ In a group of 4 or 5, bring out your collections to the table and I want you to assess your peers' collections.<br>
              ⨂ Afterwards, in a Google Docs, write your feedback for people you had assessed. Try to point out these followings: a) their documentation methodology and visual strategies, b) the coherence of their collections that are being
              presented, and c) is there a picture that resonated with you (why?). After you finish with them, save it as a .pdf and send it to anggarah@vcu.edu. <mark>This is due by the end of today's class.</mark><br>
              ⨂ Find a print publication (i.e. flyer, poster, newsletter, pamphlet, etc.) from the internet. It should not be commercial but rather in the political, social, or cultural realm. After carefully examining its contents (words, images,
              symbols, textures, etc.), reconsider the hierarchy of information based on what, in your opinion, communicates the content in a more effective, succinct, and powerful manner. You can edit the content for clarity’s sake and style (i.e.
              you may deem it desirable to simplify a call to action like "call (804) 828-2787 for more information" to simply listing the number), but do not omit critical information that would impair its functionality or change the nature of the
              event (i.e. if a flyer is annoucing a screening of 4 films, don’t change it to 2, or change the names of the films).<br>
              ⨂ Based on your findings, recreate that poster by deconstructing the design of the original printed matter you selected, and reassembling it in such a way that you create an entirely new image. Work on this for the remainder of the
              class. After you finish, export your poster <i>and</i> the original source as .png or .jpg, put them into one folder, compress the folder, and then send it to my email. <mark>This is due by Friday.</mark><br>
              ⨂ Examples (forms) are available in Canvas under Files.<br><br>
              ⨀ Once you’ve determined the most interesting way of documenting your objects, you will pick one method and build your collection further to culminate 40 images by next week. <mark>This is due by Monday.</mark>

              ⨂ In a group of 6, bring out your collections to the table and I want you to assess your peers' collections.<br>
              ⨂ Imagining that your personal collection will be exhibited in a museum, create a container through a series of progressive steps. Begin by carefully studying your collection and re-examining your initial statement. What are the
              underlying themes and aesthetic characteristics, what drew you to your subject? Select 5 adjectives that for you define the meaning, tone, and substance of your collection (examples include words like circular, detailed, mysterious,
              shiny, everyday, symbolic, soft, unique, monochrome, playful, standard, ornate, etc.). Your list of words should be compelling and as specific to your collection as they can be. Next, create a list of at least 5 possible titles for your
              collection. Naming is a creative act and an integral part of branding so consider your titles carefully; their length, opportunities for wordplay, their sound, attitude, even the visual shape of the word(s) can be distinctive.<br>
              ⨂ Try to answer these following questions (and try to be generous with your suggestions to your peers): How to expand the collection to 100 items? What is the primary interest of the collection? How does the organization of the images
              will look like? What is the dimension? Sketch what would the container look like for the remainder of the class.<br>
              ⨂ Put your responses in a Google Doc. After you finish with them, save it as a .pdf and send it to anggarah@vcu.edu. <mark>This is due by the end of today's class.</mark><br>
              ⨂ Examples (containers) are available in Canvas under Files.<br>
              ⨂ Some examples that somehow tangentially related to this project: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150222205613/https://snackmountain.com/index.php?/print/-lauren/">Lauren Adolfsen</a> took pictures with people she had never met
              before; <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140217012111/http://www.astasiototal.com/100_smiles/index_all.php5">Juan Astasio</a> artificially constructed "smiles" every day; <a href="https://hillakatki.info/One-Chair-100-Ways">Hilla
                Katki</a> photographed herself using a chair in different ways; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2DLNLTTjvM">Ely Kim</a> filmed himself dancing in a different place for 100 days.<br><br>

              ⨂ Continue developing the container that you've already started.<br>
              ⨂ Decide what dimension that is appropriate for the subject that you've chosen.<br>
              ⨂ Start researching and experimenting with the materials (e.g. vellum, piece of fabric, plastic, cardboard, plywood, etc.) and try to flesh out how your container for your collection will look like.<br>
              ⨂ Start to think how are you going to produce the container (e.g. How are you going to organize your collections? Where are you going to buy the materials? If it's a book/pamphlet, how are you going to bind it? If it's sculpture or
              other non-printed media, do you have access to the tools to make the containers? In terms of production, what are the things that you still confused with?) and what is your plan for the next few weeks?<br>

              items and tools to create said sculpture; etc.). <mark>This is due by next Monday.</mark>

              ⨂ Choose an article on Wikipedia to typeset into an 8 pages pamphlet. The text you select can be of any length (if it's too long, you can excerpt them) and can contain images, illustrations, etc. Choose one of the following dimensions
              that pairs best with your content: a) 5.5 by 8.5 inches, b) 4.25 by 11 inches, or c) 5.5 by 5.5 inches.<br>
              ⨂ The things that you include/exclude from the Wikipedia article of your choosing is your own artistic/design decision: Are you going to omit the footnotes entirely? Are you going to use the images that are in the article or are you
              going to draw them by yourself? Are you going to put the text into proper grids or are you going to put them in disarray? Please consider that the form needs to follow the content (e.g. one can make a chaotic InDesign template for an
              article about tornado because of the inherent nature of tornado itself).<br>
              ⨂ If you're still unfamiliar with Adobe InDesign, go to LinkedIn Learning and <i>watch the first 30 minutes</i> of <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning/indesign-2022-essential-training/">InDesign 2022 Essential Training</a> to get

              and the other one is a graphic design piece that you find uninspiring, dull, or ugly. Why do the pieces that you choose attract your attention positively/negatively? Be prepared to provide your reasoning. <mark>Send the two files to me

              ⨀ You will start by choosing an object, something that attracts you. Choose some thing compelling enough to inspire substantial analysis. You will remain with this object as source material for the duration of the rest of the semester, choose impulsively, yet carefully. Consider how your attraction to the object stems from its visual and material qualities. You are asked to conduct a close reading of the object and consider how its form suggests substantive themes that can be elaborated through representation. On Monday, I would like you to present research findings on what are the future potentials of your chosen object. <mark>Your first task will be to present the qualities, meanings and
potential of your object.</mark> Consider the following methods of inquiry: analysis of form, analysis of use, context and historical precedent, current and potential users or audiences, associative meanings (and how they change depending on audience and context), academic/theoretical/cultural context. <mark>Send me your research findings next Monday before 10 AM at the latest.</mark>

  ⨂ Small groups critique about the object that you chose.<br>
  ⨂ For the rest, while waiting for your turn to be critiqued, open an 11 by 17 inches Illustrator or Photoshop file and create <u>two</u> ugly posters. In this exercise, try to create posters that are uninspiring and dull according to you. Try to experiment with Illustrator or Photoshop effects that you've never tried before. The uglier the posters that you're creating, the better. <mark>Save the finished products as .png files and send them to anggarah@vcu.edu at the end of the class.</mark><br><br>
  ⨀ Start to think how to populate the content of your chosen object. Are you going to excerpt academic essays that are related to your items? Are you going to reinvent your object entirely? Are you going to use the objects to be used as something else? Are you going to repurpose the object? Are you going to make a social commentary about the object? <mark>Bring 3 different ideas to discuss how are you going to proceed for this project by Wednesday.</mark><br>
  ⨀ Develop a series of visual projects (2-3) that outline a language to express your ideas by customizing your chosen object. Think about the word "customize" liberally. This may include naming, icon or avatar, typography, imagery, palette, words or text, sculpture, website, performance, or poster. Don’t hesitate to be speculative. Sketch expansively and explore the many ways you might explicate this object visually. Certainly, as with any language, use and interpretation are
critical – it is important to consider these factors in its construction.

Don't think about grammars, run on sentences, paragraph structures, etc. Try to think critically about the word "speculative" itself. <mark>Send those two files to anggarah@vcu.edu at the end of the class.</mark><br><br>
              ⨀ Elaborate the meaning(s) of your object in a final project that extends the visual language to a specific audience and location. Emphasize the metaphoric aspect your object, its potential beyond use value or prescriptive signification. Shift your focus from what it is to what it suggests. Consider how best you might structure and weave a story, a narrative, around your object. How can you craft the meaning of the object through the telling of its form? How might you embed the subtext of design critique into this telling? Can you suggest or provoke a discussion around the nature of design practice? Bring your work-in-progress for the visual projects of your chosen objects to the class (e.g. if it's print, bring at least 2 spreads in how you're going to visualize the publication; if it's a video, bring at least a storyboard of the narration; if it's a sculpture, bring sketches of the possible forms; etc.). <mark>This is due by next Monday.</mark>

            <p><strong>Attendance</strong></p>
            <div class="left">
              The departmental faculty have drafted a revised attendance policy, carefully considering the challenges and realities of holding classes in different spaces and in fractured time frames.<br><br>
              The standard VCU attendance policy states that student absences during the semester are not expected to exceed the number of times the class meets in one week. Our department has adopted a revised policy that addresses larger issues of
              expected engagement in a course. Consistent engagement is a vital component of successful completion of course objectives. The progression of this course requires all participants to be present and actively engaged in class, both during
              synchronous on-screen meetings, in person, and with asynchronous activities. Consistency of engagement is vital for successful completion of the course objectives. Each of us carries different circumstances and capacities; we are
              accountable for our own agency. This is always true, but especially crucial now. We are a community.<br><br>

              Be present for this class; participate consistently in the regular give-and-take of the classroom environment; be willing to share thoughts and experiences, as well as willing to actively listen to the thoughts and experiences of
              others.<br><br>

              Asynchronous engagement is equally important for your success in this course. If at any point during the semester you are unable to be present, communicate this clearly with me in a timely manner. Think about the manners in which you
              feel you will be able to be fully present and active with your community—this may differ from how others respond.<br><br>

              This class operates on the principle of charity, respect, and good faith. The responsibility to uphold and bolster these principles falls equally on all members of the class. Active listening is as important as active participation,
              please be gracious and generous with both. Connecting with peers is encouraged but does not substitute for communicating with the instructor directly. Contact me as soon as possible prior to, or after you miss a class. It is your
              responsibility to make-up for missing work.

            <div class="left">You will receive ongoing feedback on your work in group critiques and individual critiques with me. Projects and performance in this course will be evaluated with respect to three primary dimensions:<br><br>

              ⨁ <u>Participation:</u> your overall conduct throughout the duration of the project as you engage with the project and with your peers. Attendance, meeting deadlines, and being prepared for class will also be accounted for.<br>

              ⨁ <u>Process:</u> strength of your personal methodology and practice; idea generation and exploration; self evaluation; overall rigor in your approach to the project; articulation and presentation of your work; criticality.<br>

              ⨁ <u>Execution:</u> the quality of your ideas; craft; clarity of organization and presentation, how your materials (paper choice, imagery, typography, etc) connect to your concept.
